				"detail": "This was a short story that is obviously episode 1 (or chapter 1, if you prefer) of a longer saga. Unfortunately, the author doesn't seem to have written much more with these characters -- if he has, he isn't selling them on Amazon. The story could use a thorough line edit, and the author seems opposed to punctuation in dialogue, for some strange reason, but errors aside, I really found myself enjoying this story. I loved the witty banter and the interaction between the characters. I could really see the scenes play out as I read, and it reminded me heavily of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\" I hope the author continues the adventures of Alex Kaiden, et al. They were a fun bunch and I'd love to visit with them again!",
