				"detail": "This was a short story that is obviously episode 1 (or chapter 1, if you prefer) of a longer saga. Unfortunately, the author doesn't seem to have written much more with these characters -- if he has, he isn't selling them on Amazon. The story could use a thorough line edit, and the author seems opposed to punctuation in dialogue, for some strange reason, but errors aside, I really found myself enjoying this story. I loved the witty banter and the interaction between the characters. I could really see the scenes play out as I read, and it reminded me heavily of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\" I hope the author continues the adventures of Alex Kaiden, et al. They were a fun bunch and I'd love to visit with them again!",

			"detail": "In a similar lighthearted literary vein as Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett, This series of stories successfully captures the Englishness of the hero (I envision Rowan Atkinson as Alex) and his band of subversives as they carom haphazardly around the universe hoping to save humanity from the evil machinations of the Pathfinders. A thoroughly enjoyable read!",
